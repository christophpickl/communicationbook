* conflicts are when both express (their pain, usually in a judgmental/externalizing way) at the same time, and no one is listening; 2 monologues, diagonal conversation.
  * one needs to stay with empathetical listening (acknowledge, not agree) to have a parallel conversation. the other expresses honestly (staying with own experience; emotions/needs, preferably judgment free, otherwise listener needs to translate jackal into giraffe)
  * slow down the conversation, to be aware of who has the focus right now. if we switch, notice it. it's like a dance: if both lead, we step on each other feet, hurt each other, and it's definitely not enjoyable, but a domination-power fight.
  * when to switch from listening to expressing? slow down, saves time. the other needs usually more time than expected, still full of their own thing. of course something arises in my which wants to be expressed as well, patience, later, put it aside, park it. listen, give empathy,... until they almost beg you to express yourself. they will tell you, let you know when they are finished (also read subtle shifts, cues in body language, facial expression, tension levels, tone of voice).
* the more i'm open to hear a "no" to my request, the more i'm able to ask freely; it is OF MOST IMPORTANCE to be able to hear a "no" to your request
  * please don't ask me and make me pay (punish, being angry) for saying "no"; e.g. "go for a walk?" - "no, busy with something" - "you never want to"
  * sometimes people play this hidden game, where a question is not actually a question, and hearing a question (what actually being done) is risky/dangerous/painful; people don't know themselves they are actually asking a non-question, and get confused
  * sometimes confuse their own old wound being touched VS inflicted, and get defensively aggressive; i have compassion for that, that confusion, that pain, and the need to protect
  * we so often hold back our requests; dear to request the wildest things, as long as you are open to hear a "no" (the receiver will also feel that)
  * the request (with a "no") is the beginning of a dialog, not the end
  * a request is (among others): doable, measurable, concrete (executable and clear, operation): not "give me space" or "be there for me" (it's a need/too abstract), but rather "i want to have the living room for myself tonight", "listen to me for the next 5 minutes"
    * also present, executable NOW, not something in the future: "can you always listen to me?"
    * also positive formulated, not "don't jump on the bed" (because now we put the nice thing into someone's head, very mean actually) instead "please walk on the ground, sit on the chair, and lie on the bed"
  * when expressing a request, always followed by a need, as it creates compassion: instead of "mom, give me money please" do a "i want to go with the guys to the cinema and not want to be an outsider (belonging), so can i have some money?"
* nice if we are able to express our needs, stating observations and how we feel, and ending with a clear, formally correct request; yet, sometimes A) the receiver has jackal-ears, not being able to see the beauty and instead is afraid of obligation/guilt/pressure/demand and B) we (sometimes unconsciously) express a sneaky demand; to verify whether it's a true request or an evil demand is when we receive a "no", as the request can welcome it, the demand will feel negative about it
  * "no" is not a thing, it's absence; it doesn't tell what you want, but only what you don't want, which isn't helpful (there is a yes underneath the no, we need to look for that)
  * it feels like a rejection, but there is no such thing in reality as a rejection; it is touching our fears and insecurities; because a simple "no" (without an explanation, without a yes), leaves uncertainty, the unknown, and our brains are developed to assume the worst-case scenario to keep us alive; in nature, that was great, today it's maladaptive; back then uncertainty and threats were rare, so this mechanism helped us; but today, in our hyper-connected overly-social environment with millions of people around us, this once helpful mechanism brings terror over us; byron katie, right?! reality is actually very safe, all the pain/suffering is coming from imagination-land (being in conflict with reality)
* compromises are "half-yeses", giving in. we both don't get what we want, it's not serving life (although it has the best intention and a very good reputation in our society, just as appologizing/saying sorry). but we can do better, both our needs can be met at the same time! we just need to talk, stay open/curious/compassionate, be more aware of what's going on inside, feel safe, be vulnerable, owning it, staying connected, to us, our partner and life itself. with every "half yes" you accumulate some hatred
* needs are motivations of all our behaviors; what we say is usually out of expressing our needs (so often in a very unhealthy/tragic way)
* incorporate GDoc "emotions"
* add (more) drawings to the book; e.g. "talking over each other's heads", two monologues, instead one dialogue; not connected with each other/not seeing/hearing each other, only with our own story (arrows moves above head); as we "listen to reply, and not listen to understand" usually; saying "yes, and ...", to go on a journey together, with curiosity/compassion; it's like in circling
  * from monologue to dialogue: the intention must be first to connect, establish contact, and then come the mechanics (observation/emotion/need/request)
* the goal: obviously a more connecting communication with someone else, focusing on what's alive (first connection, then solution); also how communicate with ourselves (thinking); but ultimately a spiritual goal, to see reality for what it is (to see deeper, what's actually going on; e.g. you can't make me feel anything)
* empathic listening: not so much listening to the words being said, definitely don't try to hear what they are thinking (suicidal!) but try to see the beauty underneath, an expression of a universal (we all share) human need (people saying "please", a request for love), sometimes though expressed in a tragic way (we need to look through that)
* a request is not a command/demand/expectations; always be prepared to receive a "no" (which is a "yes" to oneself, a need not being met if doing so; only say yes if it's making life for you wonderful as well); the goal is not to get what we want, but the goal is to establish connection/stay connected.
* define "communication": latin 'cum unio' - with union/uniformity (unus); connection
* key ingredients for a connection: listen, try to understand, empathize, reflect, be with the other with curiosity (how is it to be you), acknowledge/accept (not necessarily agree!)
* we usually do "two simultan monologues" instead of a true conversation; there is no connection, as we are stuck in our own story (see improv acting "yes, and"); talking "over each other's heads";
* difference analysis and giving empathy (only guessing feelings and needs; never hear what the other person thinks, unless you want to make your life miserable; dont guess their thoughts = reinforce jackal)
* there is no "no", only needs not fulfilled, preventing from saying "yes"
* ask for reflection, to verify no misunderstandings: what did you hear me saying?
* when to switch from giving empathy to go into content, answering questions, talk about requests: when fully connected with each other, from the heart, the needs behind, feeling seen
* objective not to change someone or get results, but to establish a quality of connection where everybody's needs are met through natural giving
* why nvc? not to get what we want. go to dog obedience school. like skinner's punishment and reward. might work short term, but disproportional high costs
  - 1. establish quality of connection, equals. not right/wrong.
  - 2. both needs matter equally.
  - 3. only do, when natural giving (not guilt, wanting return, obedience, ...)
* dont jump too quickly to solving, wait until enough empathy received, when people soften/open
* giraffe parrot: mechanically repeat, without a genuine interest/curiousity in the other's world
* the emotions are 10%, the need is 90% there we actually connect
* our pain is not because of others (non/behavior) but because our needs were not met
* psychoanalytical jackal, asking "what kind of pain", it's directing, instead of empathetically following
* separate needs from request, "you need me to..."
* giraffe mouth+ear: the way we speak and the way hear others (it's bidirectional)
* watch out for keywords always and never. technically incorrect, also not precise. so something else is being expressed
* judgments/diagnosis like overthinking, too emotional, drama queen... very painful. what is actually meant by it, let's rephrase it. and why is the person behaving/doing this, whats the intention/reason behind?
* if we cant have compassion with it, we have not made peace with it yet within ourselves. yes, there is harmful behavior, yet see it with kindness or anger?
* cant give what you dont have yourself. money, love, and also empathy. charge yourself up, before trying to give. or recharge when empty during conversation. when people received enough, timing, they usually become open for advice/solutions.

## 20 Signs You're Emotionally Mature, by Alain de Botton

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-J9BVBjK3o

1. see that nastyness + idiocity ==> fear + anxiety
  - world is not full of monsters + fools
2. my thoughts + feelings need to be properly communicated
  - speak calmly and clearly so they understand
3. apologize when doing mistakes (and they WILL happen)
4. get confidence because every else is too stupid/scared/lost
  - not because you are best, we are just making that up
5. forgive your parents, they didnt want to hurt you, they had their demons too
  - anger turns to pitty and compassion
6. talk about serious things when rested, not in rush, not drunk, had food, in good mood
7. dont store pain when being hurt, dont expect others to know whats wrong
   -> tell them straight, if they get it forgive them, otherwise too (in a different way) ;)
8. seize to believe in perfection (love, live, job); "good enough" is ok
9. be a bit more pessismistic how things turn out, lose idealism
  - therefor become more calm, patient, forgiving soul
10. each weakness in character == linked to counterbalancing strength
  - look at the whole picture; perfect people dont exist
11. fall in love less easily (imature get a crush instantly)
12. acknowledge your own issues and communicate those cactus to others
  - give others kindly warnings about when you might become a challenge
13. forgive yourself for your errors+fooliness
  - become a friend to yourself; you are an idiot, but a beloving one (as we all are)
14. make peace with your stubborn child inside you
  - if the 2 year old cries, give him the attention he needs
15. celebrate the little things, seize to put too much hope in grand plans
  - satisfication comes in increments of minutes; flowers, sky, small pleasures
16. opinion of others are not that important, dont invest too much to polish your image (fame)
  - you should be ok with being you, and maybe 1 or 2 other (love)
17. hear feedback, critize is not intended to humiliate; avoid putting armor and deny problems
18. get aware of the things that pain you; get out of it and get a new perspective
  - walk in nature, get a pet, more appreciation
19. past shaped my behavior; having predispositions to exaggarte in certain areas
  - get sceptical about first impulses, and sometimes not go with first feelings
20. realize that others are not that much interested in my (good/bad) news only
  - listen and let them talk, and share vulnerabilities


## Active/Empathetic Listening

What?! But I'm already listening!
Well, depends on the definition of the words. You might be hearing another person's words, whereas truly listening from the heart with full attention is something different. Same as with simply looking (having the eyes open) or seeing (consciousness on the visual sensation, without any additions, like interpretations of what it is). Sometimes, for example in Non-Violent Communication, they call it “empathically listening”. There might be minor differences in emphasizes, but basically the underlying change is the same.
It is difficult to talk about it, but once you've experienced it, you will feel the substantial difference between these two, and so will the people being listened to. The magic created can sometimes feel uncomfortable to people who are not used to be truly seen and heard, but isn't it what in the end, we all are looking for?
Why should I do that?
Because it creates a deeper connection with the people around you. It leads to true understanding, seeing the other person for whom s/he is truly, rather of going into disconnection due to judgements and holding on to own stories and beliefs around the content. Acceptance, rather than wanting to change. Fewer struggles, fewer fights. More harmony, more peace. To give the other person one’s full attention, presence being the biggest present we can give each other. To witness with curiosity whatever is alive in the other person, and simply be there.
How can I possibly achieve it?
Simply being aware of what is being said, doesn't really help, I know, still it is the only advice one can give. Fortunately, there are some tips’n'tricks. You can, for example, simply repeat the words being spoken in your head. This will force you to stay focused, no matter what. It is a rather cognitive approach, which might lead to less connection on a deeper, emotional level and grasping the content properly. Still, it's a tool to be considered. Listening means listening, so no talking, obviously. No need to ask questions, even if you didn't get some words. It's not so much that you understand it, but rather that the other person has expressed it and feels being heard and seen. You can nod and express a "mhm" sound occasionally, to let the other person know you are still with her/him, but refrain from “directing” or interrupt the flow. To be empathetic, you try to understand how this feels for the other. Guess emotions, without adding anything. Try to put yourself into the other person's position. You will notice how quickly you will go into your interpretation mode. No need to analyze, fix, solve, give advice, come up with own stories. The hardest thing to do is to avoid doing that, while listening. Don't prepare your response while listening. Simply listen, and trust yourself that you will remember the most important things anyway. Once you've mastered to listen, you can try to feel with the other person's emotions. To feel what they feel, to resonate with your and their whole being. Additionally, you can make use of your analytical mind and observe body language. Watch the fingers, the breath, the change in facial expression. And also the sound of the voice, the pitch, the speed, the breaks being taken or not. There is a lot being said between the lines. The obvious is sometimes not the significant.
Any other insightful advice I can use?
Sure, the biggest one is the tool of “reflect back”. After the person has shared without interruption fully, you take some time to try to mirror undistorted what has been shared. Let the other person verify whether it is what s/he was saying, or meant to say. It will give a feeling of truly being seen and heard, as well as it's pretty fascinating to see oneself through the words of another person. As the finger cannot touch itself, and the tongue cannot taste itself, the eye cannot see itself; so also can't the ego. We need each other for that.

## NVC NL course notes

* watch out for socially desirable behavior/talk; rather take care of your needs, and request them, align with others; don't hold back, and also care about others
* the expression "like a young boy feeding a duck" = give with love is receiving. to serve life, other's request to satisfy needs.
* every beginning is difficult (baby giraffe), be compassionate to yourself, find a compassionate environment (to practice, which is forgiving to a novice)
* WHY AM I READING THIS BOOK?
    * for more connection, intimacy, love, peace, depth, authenticity in my relationships (with myself, others, friends/family/work/...)
    * i am convinced that better communication make the world a better place
    * i experience difficulties myself in communication with others and want to improve that
    * i simply need some practice, a guide on how to actually do it better, not only a pure theoretical exposure
    * i can't change others, so i want to be good enough myself, to compensate for the "short-comings" of others
    * i feel unbearable pain how we constantly miscommunicate (and don't even realize it); i feel overwhelming joy about the positive response of others when they receive empathy, when we finally really meet
* don't wait too long expressing yourself => otherwise explosion!
    * go slow, feel inside, be more sensitive, feel your bodily sensations (indicator of emotional state)
    * have the courage to speak up, own your irrational voice/judgments/projections/triggers, let the inner child talk for a moment, give it space
* is it a tool? a way of looking at life? only a perspective or seeing reality more clearly as it is?!
* to avoid sounding like a mechanical robot: keep the intention your heart: CONNECTION OVER CONTENT/correction (don't correct/suggest to others)
    * first empathy, only when connection established, being seen, then ready to go to solution mode
    * especially for men: slow down with solving; "just listen/don't just do something, stand there"; be present, the biggest present we can give
* (rational compassion over) EMPATHY OVER EDUCATION
* "hurt people hurt people"; tout comprendez c'est tout pardonnez; if they hurt is, we don't see them fully (yet), and maybe have touched our own wound
* even if the person has done something totally (absolutely) stupid, don't criticise: see the other, in all his stupidity; well-intention seeing. "you tried hard, feel frustrated/disappointed now? can i be there for you?"
* don't REACT (reflex, blindly), but instead slow down, be aware (use awareness), stay with yourself, and own your experience
    * stoicism: not events, but our interpretation (a cognitive task, evoking emotions) of them make us feel uncomfortable (bad, afraid, guilty, pain)
    * there's a stimulus/event/trigger, an emotion (anger), because a need isn't satisfied. not "you are wrong".
    * first connect to yourself, self-connection to your inner world
    * then respond from a conscious, connected place: "i ... because i..." ("ik... omdat ik..."), e.g. "i feel anger because i have a need for silence."
        * or, to consciously explore the world of the other: "you ... because you ...", e.g. "i can imagine that you feel frustrated because you have a need to be reliable?"
        * giraffe mouth OR giraffe ear; both giraffes do it from a heart-connection underneath
* first self-connection (self-empathy), then other-connection, with deep honesty: 1) self-expression (mouth) then 2) receive other (ear)
* 4 elements: observation - emotion - need - request
* 3 interaction types:
    * i within myself, self-understanding/compassion
    * i express myself to you (ask for love)
    * i create space for you (give love)
* "a spiritual/philosophical practice"
* take away blame/criticism/judgments; to fully own it, which is more painful, yet the solution
    * INTROSPECTION OVER PROJECTION; "you are not responsible for my emotional response" (only for your own behavior)
    * we can't change others, but we can change ourselves (our interpretations, ...)
* we humans are animals of needs (behoeftedieren) = everything we do is in order to serve our needs
* my personal top needs (find them yourself from the needs-list): integrity/authenticity/honesty/transparency, empathy/compassion/acceptance, growth, structure/consistency, competence/professionality/accuracy/correctness/precision/nuance, ...
* where do your needs come from? basic human/biology? or imprinted from parents/upbringing, society/media/environment?
    * needs are not an activity (=strategy); a strategy is there for a need!
    * a need has nothing to do with another (specific) person; e.g. i need physical intimacy, but i do NOT need cuddles with you specifically (thus, if you say "no" to my request, i can go and look somewhere else for it, maybe even give it to myself instead)
    * same with emotions: "feeling excluded" is not an (basic) emotion; there are categories of emotion in literature; complex ones, social, primary/secondary, ...
* expressing a need is basically saying "yes", what i want, adding something. positively formulated (not "no", negative, removing something); e.g. "stop making noise" => "maintain silence"
    * e.g. when i think "this is bad/wrong", this means that a need was touched; it has primarily to do with myself (my need), not the other ('s behavior... just the stimulus, not the cause)
* TIP: how to feel what i feel: notice physical sensations, location and qualification. slow down, breathe, feel. simple sensations. be able to "diagnose" to an emotion. then associate need.
* self-investigation, stay silent, but: "niet omdat je friest, maar omdat je ervoor kiest" (=not because you freeze, but because you choose for it)
* a request is "an attempt for more connection"
* 1) ANGER: celebrate your jackals (go deper) 2) PAIN: empathize with it (more beauty arising) 3) CARE: establish connection (arriving at love)
    * emotions are indications of un/met needs
    * judgments are (tragic) expressions of un/met needs ("oordeel in jouw voordeel")
* at the core are needs > emotions > judgments > behavior
* judgments help us to see ourselves (our needs) better (or sometimes just a strategy to feel more safe)
* it's not that we think too much, we just haven't learned yet how to use the mind machine properly; we get training to drive a car, but not a brain
    * some emotions are triggered by biology/genetically (snakes, spiders), which higher cognitive functions (thinking) are not involved at all
    * the separation head-body is counter-productive (feel-think, man-women, ...).
    * thinking creates an imagined reality, useful (most of the times, if ~needed~ used appropriately)
    * not the tool (feel/think) is "bad", but the way we (mis-)use it (incompetence); it's easier to blame the tool instead of our own incapability
    * the body sometimes is confused too, it's not always right; but it potentially can help
        * different models of emotions exist ... unclear (emotions, stimulus, thought, physical sensations)
    * we must think more clearly/nuanced, we must feel deeper; all with courage to stay with discomfort
* using body as signal-giver: over time learn your "language"; e.g. legs tensed => stressed, sweaty hands => nervous
* event -> perception -> interpretation -> need -> emotion -> behavior (or something like it)
* exercise: 1) list most important needs 2) list strategies for those needs
    * e.g. need for relaxation: meditation, nap, movement/dance, clean up, music, read, watch inspirational TV, masturbation, cuddle
* NEED communcation OVER STRATEGY communication
    * especially when mentioning the strategy without the need!
    * don't confuse the tittie with the milk ;)
* past pain experiences help us to learn better about our own needs
* there's no "no", just a need that prevent us from saying a "full yes"; i always want to "yes", but a certain needs prevent me from doing so; how can we resolve it?
* if others don't have this skill developed yet, it is about you to support, to use your skill to explore their inner world (needs, emotions) to help them connect to themselves
* a command from an authority injures our core need of autonomy (=being able to make decisions ourselves)
* CAVE: no top-down, but bottom-up approach: no mechanics first (to get what you want), but feel deeply/be emotional/care, love, connection... and from that place let words come up themselves
* empathy is not about agreeing but seeing:
    * e.g. "i'm such a fat pig" -> NO: "no, you're slim, com on", ouch, not being seen, also being told that i'm wrong now
        * YES: "i can imagine that you feel unhappy with your body? you want to be slim, fit in, liked and loved because of your body? not made fun of, being excluded? attractive to the other sex, to find a partner, to find love?" exploring the rationality behind the irrationality.
* receiving a "no": (re-)condition by positive association, touch exercise, pain (tom's exercise); say stop by saying "no" and other response with "thank you"
    * "yes gets value through no", trust you'll state your boundaries. i feel free to do (whatever).
* you can either be right or have harmony
    * being right costs the other's person face, the relationship will be damaged; is it worth it? (sometimes it is; "protective force")
* emotions not through others! self-victimization!
    * we can't make each other feel anything (angry/happy). but: others can show behavior, which we will interpret in a way that make ourselves feel a specific emotion. goal: disentanglement!
* self-compassion, to forgive "one's sins", the love underneath, the beauty; leading to other-compassion
    * the person who raped me, did it as a "cry for love"
* giraffe...
    * jackal: a language based on judgments; correcting others
    * giraffe = a language of life, establishing more connection (to oneself and others)
    * she has biggest heart land-mammal
    * but also longest neck: sees far into the future, as well as into our hearts; see above (beyond) said words/jdugments; seeing through, the actual emotions/needs underneath (simultan-translator)
    * can eat cactus, with spikes = can hear difficult expressions and digest them
    * empathetical feel with the other (but always first self-connect), not hearing words too literally!
* a good workshop uses the workshop's atmosphere/situation to apply directly what's being taught (real life demonstration)
    * the teacher can demonstrate/inspire on the spot
    * participants use NVC to express in the moment; e.g. your laptop sounds, ... want to sit there, ... don't feel understood, ...
* a good teacher is able to show deep empathy/emotions, and has clarity/structure in teaching. he is grounded, confident, strong; courageous.
* we don't see what there is, we see what there is
    * we filter mini selection of total perception; that what is filtered, is then interpreted, compared to past experiences, evaluated with our social programming/values, judged/analyzed/diagnosed => talk/behave
* three layers:
    * talk: judge, anger, externalize, victimization, projection
    * listen: empathy, pain, understanding, internalize, empower, reflect, kind
    * be: love, care, connection, unconditional, acceptance
* with autism: 1) hear everything literally, but humans talk very indirect, and usually don't know themselves what they want/need; it's now about reading between the lines, guessing. empathy.
    * and 2) theory of mind is thus extra difficult, but can be learned/compensated for
* EXERCISE: some person said/did something, that touched me, when I want to keep in my life
* spirituality is a proto-scientific form of psychology/psychotherapy
    * how we make sense of reality, creating/constructing it
    * our limited capacities, biases/heuristics; e.g. eckert tolle, alan watts, ram das, osho, ...
* a more nuanced language/words of what's going on inside (emotions/needs)
    * passive understanding is mostly there; the goal is to actively use them when trying to connect what's alive in me now
* to reflect back: literally repeat what has been said.
    * to stay with the other, not bring myself in.
    * not as a parrot "in&out like a robot", but really first let it sink in, feeling it!
    * maybe guess more underneath; curiously, to take away the parrot-style
* we usually go too quickly in solution mode: CONNECTION OVER CONTENT
    * we don't talk about the situation
    * ? tricky: when to switch the modes?
    * ? also: how to have capacity for the other, when i'm myself still in pain?
* giving empathy != to analyze (common misconception of ignorant people; similar as acceptance != agreeing)
    * but maybe not a semantic (word) issue, someone is expressing a need. "don't be too theoretical with analyzing my emotions"...
    * again: don't correct, don't stay too literal/precise; she is asking for something (i'm too much focused on phrasing/words); she might be confused with words&meaning...
    * just stay curious with what she is trying to say underneath, what's going on, work together with her to understand what she actually tries to say (yet not finding the right words which would help me understand her)
* reflect: not about agreeing, but acknowledge.
    * not the whole sentence/content, just a few words are ok
    * hold back your own judgment/advice/explanations/...
    * don't bring in yourself
    * don't try to change the other person (nevertheless how wrong they may seem)
    * ability to let go of one's own ego (-desires)
* empathy (emotional) VS analyse (cognitive)... (inleven VS invullen)
    * NIVEA: Niet Invullen Voor Emand Anders
    * empathy: intentie connectie; from self-connection, imagine using own universal needs, to guess, sharing empathetical presence
* always rephrase to positive formulation, e.g.: "i wasn't strong enough" => "i have a desire to be strong enough"
* observation: "you ignored me" (no, interpretation); "you didn't call me" (nope, maybe she did), "i didn't receive a call" (YES, make it about yourself)
* personal example: 1) "when i shared about my sickleave, not being able to events due to my financial situation, you said something like that i shall then just work to earn money"
    * 2) i felt perplex, pain and lonely, not being seen.
    * 3) i have a need to be seen, to be supported, soft friendship and loyalty.
    * 4) are you willing to give me empathy in this, in my situation?
    * "toen ik mijn verhaal delde, toen wij belten, horde ik je zeggen wat ik anders zou kunnen doen" => "toen ik mijn verhaal met je delde, horde ik je zeggen 'dus ga terug werken'"
* to see what really is, to separate observations/interpretations, to disentangle, see myself and others, own my emotions/responses/judgment/projections/... is the first step towards awakening.
* i'm not responsible for your emotional response, but i'm indeed responsible for my behavior
    * i could (it would be beneficial for sure) consider the impact of it, yes
* if i feel not being taken seriously, then i feel: angry, perplex, surprised, furious, insecure, helpless, lonely, ignored, disappointed, at unease, dissatisfied, frustrated, little/belittled, frozen, ...
    * watch out for PSEUDO-EMOTIONAL-EXPRESSIONS! (underneath them are real emotions)
        * "i feel that you ..." e.g. "... don't listen to me" (gefuehl/gedanke, feeling/thought VS emotion)
        * for pseudos, other people are needed, for real emotions others are NOT necessary (feeling excluded VS feeling lonely)
* REQUEST:
    * people sometimes/mostly use very vague language, you need to put effort to read between/beneath. when they express a wish or similar, ask back if there was a request => get clarity. guess.
    * e.g. personal example: melinde, i'd like you to give me empathy, to listen to me, my pain, my situation, and support me, staying curious with me, for let's say 5 minutes in total. are you willing to do that?
    * Requests need to be: Positive - Actionable - Person-focused - Measurable - Executable - Time-limited - Specific (PAPMETS)
* how to respond to a request:
    * yes: enriches your life, making it more wonderful
    * yes: feeling like a young boy feeding a duck
    * no: fear of punishment
    * no: out of obligation, or duty
    * no: want something else in return/back (a trade, reward)
* 2 types of requests (see worksheets from teacher):
    * 1) connection request (preliminary necessary sometimes to continue); e.g. "i'm curious how is that for you to hear that?"
        * very important, to show you not only interested to express your own pain, and want to be seen, but also give space for the other person (his pain/experience)
        * also will determine how to proceed; slow down? further? faster? give/receive empathy?
        * also possible: check-connection-request: ask for validation of message, reflect back message essence
    * 2) action-request (conventional)
    * and again: CONNECTION OVER > MECHANICS (own emotions, depth, vulnerability)
* situations training:
    * 1) a fellow bicyclist doesn't stop at a stop line, i did an emergency break
    * 2) i felt shocked, paniced, unsafe
    * 3) as I was afraid of my health, i need to trust we agree to the law
    * 4) do you see my point of view? can you imagine that it was a real shock for me?
    * i can imagine you were in a rush and didn't see the stop line? or was my behavior unclear for you whether i'd continue?
    * are you willing to share how it was for you? i can imagine you were in shock too?
    * because i care for your, and mine, well-being. and i want us to emotionally have closure for us.
* in the heat of the moment, it's fucking difficult to give empathy => breathe, slow down, ground (maybe even take a break, go for a walk, separate in order to come back together again)
* watch out: asking, being curious about the other, is a need of myself (curiousity); not bad, just be aware of the shift of attention.
* ACKNOWLEDGE OVER AGREE
    * dont correct or agree, just see the world of the other person
    * e.g. me feeling fat... now feel double bad, because i'm fat and wrong, after you told me that i'm not fat
    * better: reflect back + guess how it must be for the other feeling like that
* story in public transportation, father with 2 annoying kids; finally approach him, he says sorry, mother just died. feeling guilty.
* EXERCISE: 3 positions, and be clear about use, use the 4 steps (check/connection-request)... see worksheet
* EXERCISE: 3 min active listening, share something you are enthusiastic about; other person afterwards writes down list of needs he heard, then check both with speaker what resonates; the list = a present of "i heard you". to feel seen, very much, from the heart :)

## about emotions

* no emotion is bad by itself, emotions are like a guide/compass/friend, indicator; they should not blind you, but empower you, give insight.
    * we need to be aware of irrational fear, investigate, and sooth it, listen to what it's expressing underneath; without (rational) fear, i'd be dead long time ago
    * anger isn't bad either; wrath is, it's unjustified anger which expresses itself destructively; being angry at problems, not at people, while staying connected and respectful (mindfulness)
        * do nothing which you will regret afterwards.
    * jealousy is pointing to a place of insecurity within ourselves, like a little baby screaming for attention, so we can heal that spot
    * worst: pretending an emotion is not there, not doing the investigation; also bad: declaring some emotions as bad, suppressing them, not listening to them what they have to say (need is/not satisfied)
    * => as always, it's about moderation, or in this case more about proportionality and appropriateness
        * if sometimes steps on my foot, little anger; if someone kills my wife, lots of anger.
        * if i win a price, i shall be happy; if my mother dies, i shall be sad (sadness is a good=appropriate expression, and i shall NOT be happy in this moment as it would be some unhealthy coping mechanism)
    * men turn sadness into anger, women anger into sadness
* => incorporate google doc on emotions
